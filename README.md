# Eufy Security integration for Home Assistant

**Update** This is a fork off of [@nonsleepr](https://github.com/nonsleepr/ha-eufy-security)'s implemenation. It adds more supported devices and includes more information about each device. This is in part because of a fork of [@FuzzyMistborn](https://github.com/FuzzyMistborn/python-eufy-security) and [@keshavdv](https://github.com/keshavdv/python-eufy-security)'s library.

At this moment, this repo simply extracts [@bachya](https://github.com/bachya)'s [PR for Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/28443) which uses [@FuzzyMistborn](https://github.com/FuzzyMistborn)'s package [`python-eufy-security`](https://github.com/FuzzyMistborn/python-eufy-security).
